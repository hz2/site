  - I refer to this book as my bible. An excerpt that has stuck with me
    (and quite frankly guided life choices) is:

> I am preaching the message that, with apparently only one life to live on
> this earth, you ought to try to make significant contributions to
> humanity rather than just get along through life comfortably--that the
> life of trying to achieve excellence in some area is in itself a worthy
> goal for your life. It has often been observed the true gain is in the
> struggle and not in the achievement--a life without a struggle on your
> part to make yourself excellent is hardly a life worth living.
> This, it must be observed, is an opinion and not fact, but it is based on
> observing many people's lives and speculating on their total happiness
> rather than the moment-to-moment pleasures they enjoyed. Again, this opinion
> of their happiness must be my own interpretation as no one can know another's
> life. Many reports by people who have written about the "good life" agree
> with the above opinion. Notice I leave it to you to pick your goals of
> excellence, but claim only a life without such a goal is not really living,
> but merely existing--in my opinion. In ancient Greece, Socrates (469-399 BC)
> said that "the unexamined life is not worth living."

I don't know about you, but after reading this passage, I was ready to run
through a brick wall lol. This book gets into technical topics while still
maintaining a philosophical lens on learning and doing science/engineering by
a master of the craft.
