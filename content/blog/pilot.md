I have been planning on writing a blog for awhile and since I have two says
until 2026, I figured I could say I started it in 2025 which makes it sound
longer than it is. I made the [site](https://github.com/hz2/site) today along
with the [fitness tracker](https://github.com/hz2/fitness) today so the site
will probably evolve over time.

This blog is going to consist of various thoughts and projects I work on
(outside of work) as well as notes on things I find interesting. It will also
include other bits about my life that I want to document that is not on social
media.

If anyone has suggestions or wants to comment on something, feel free to put
it in a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/hz2/site/issues) since this is only
a static site.
